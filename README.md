### hey 👋🏽

I started coding by accident a few years ago, and I've only gotten more into it since.

Check out [my website](https://dragonwocky.me/) for some of my projects, or browse through their code here on GitHub.

Want me to build you something? [Sure](https://dragonwocky.me/#hire-me)!

I've also got a handy guide on a [full setup/configuration of the WSL](https://dragonwocky.me/posts/wsl-setup), if you're interested.
