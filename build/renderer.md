## notes on the html renderer:

- databases are linked to instead of rendered
- pdf embeds are treated as file embeds
- google drive embeds are treated as bookmarks
- if exporting a non-public page, media (files + images etc.) will be inaccessible to viewers
  not signed in to your notion account as they are not downloaded but served from notion's aws
