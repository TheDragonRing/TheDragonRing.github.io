Alphahex
========
---------
This is the first website template I have ever made from scratch. It also has a few pre-built scripts included that'll make building your next site much easier.

Features:
---------

  **Responsive** â€” The site template is built to be both mobile friendly and desktop friendly, with different layouts that automatically adjust to your screen or windows size.

  **Scripts** - It comes with a contact form that uses a customizable emailing script (PHP), a download counter for the projects page (PHP), and a couple of extras like a 'scroll to top' function, an automatically updating copyright and content that fades in at a comfortable speed when the page loads (jQuery/JavaScript).

  **Blog** - The template has a self-managed blog template included, with posts and an RSS feed that are very easy to use and blend in with the look of the rest of the site.

Downloading & Installing:
-------------------------

  **Downloading** - Go to https://thedragonring.me/projects, find Alphahex and click the download button.

  **Installing** - Extract the downloaded files and move them to your site's root (or wherever you want it to go) and customize the file. Voila, done!

  _If you plan on using the PHP scripts, make sure you are using a host that has installed PHP._
