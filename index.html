        <h2>"About Me"</h2>
        <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies:</h3>
        <p>I am completely addicted to reading. Any time I have free time, the first thing I want to do is read. It's both fun and I learn a lot from the books I read (although I usually read fictional novels, I also like true stories from the point of view of a made-up character). The only time I ever successfully recorded every single book I read resulted in me reading 75 books in three weeks - that was 3 years ago, and I still don't know how I do it!
          <br>
        If I'm not reading, then you can usually find me on the computer. I spend the other half of my free time coding websites or working on some small programming project. I started teaching myself how in January 2016, but I have come a long way since then. To see some of what I've done, go check out the projects section on my site.</p>
        <h3 id="skills">Skills:</h3>
        <p>
          - PHP: I am self-taught in this, I use it often for various projects and scripts.
            <br>
          - JS & jQuery: I know how to do simple tasks with these, but for more complicated things or experimenting with something new I always have to do a lot of research.
            <br>
          - HTML & CSS: I was originally self-taught, but I have learnt a lot since then and now am able to integrate them together to make sites like this.
