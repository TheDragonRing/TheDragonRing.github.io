### what can i do?

sure, i dabble in other things, but primarily i'm a web developer. i
can build you any website you want, backend and frontend.
(realistically: i'm not gonna build you the next roblox. and yes, i've
gotten that request before). i also do discord bots and the like.

i specialise in javascript, am by necessity good with html, and can
whip up some smooth designs with css. i'm reasonably fluent in python
and when push comes to shove i can pull out some php.

### what will it cost?

that all depends on you. cost will be calculated per hour of work. so,
the more decisive you are (pick what you want from the start, i don't
want to have to spend hours quizzing you to figure out what to do),
the cheaper it'll be.

also, project size and extra expenses cost. if it's a basic website,
easy. if you need a host and a domain, you pay for them and i'll teach
you what to do with them.

### how long will it take?

there's no formula for how long something could take me, but if there
was it'd be something like _project size \* client decisiveness_.
also, i'm still at school, so there will be times when it takes
priority. likely though, a smaller project (discord bot or portfolio
website) could be done in a week (4-14 hours of work). anything beyond
that i cannot predict.
